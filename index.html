<h1> ABOUT ME </h1>
<h3> WARDA FARHAN </h3>
<P> Hello! My name is Warda, and I am an undergraduate student of computer engineering at Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering and Technology, part of Batch 31.</p>
<p> I am from Islamabad, Pakistan; I did my A levels from Roots Ivy International School - Riverview Campus - and O levels from The City School, DHA Campus Islamabad. My subjects comprised of Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Urdu in A levels, but I studied Computer Science in O levels, which led to my interest in programming and computer engineering.</p>
<p> My accomplishments include a national distinction in O level Computer Science, an honourable mention for my app Fight Against Covid-19 in the MIT App Inventor Hackathon, an interactive fiction game addressing social media and cyber ethics (hosted on itch.io), a bronze medal in the International Kangaroo Lingustic Contest, and a shortlisted story for the CLF Young Author's Award. My hobbies include reading and writing, mostly fiction and creative non-fiction.</p>
